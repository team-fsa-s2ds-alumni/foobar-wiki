# Welcome to the FHRSOP Wiki!

![Banner](https://github.com/S2DSLondon/Aug20_FSA/blob/master/static/banner_small.png)

Here you will find a series of pages that will help you navigate the FHRS Online Platforms (FHRSOP) repository, which provides an interface for navigating the landscape of online food platforms. To do so, it uses data obtained automatically retrieved from different webs to assemble a database that powers an interactive dashboard with listings and information of interest on Food Business Operators (FBOs) and other food agents.

The Wiki is organised into three main sections:

* **Technical Guide**: Everything you need to know to run FHRSOP from a front- and back-end developer point of view.

* **User Guides**: Aimed at people who are just going to explore FHRSOP's database and interactive dashboard.

* **Ethics**: Summary of the ethical considerations that have been taken into consideration in building FHRSOP.

Use the table on the right-hand menu to go to the different pages of each section.
