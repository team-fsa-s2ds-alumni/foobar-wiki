## Description <a name="description"></a>

The data preprocessing is automated by _FHRSOP.py_'s commands. Currently, the preprocessors are saved in three files: _DeliverooPreprocessor.py_, _FbmkplacePreprocessor.py_, and _KukdPreprocessor.py_. These files contain class objects, and these objects operate on the raw .json outputs from the corresponding platforms from the scraping stage. The complete data preprocessing stage outputs cleaned data in pandas dataframe format as well as .csv files.

## Input Files <a name="source"></a>

The preprocessing stage takes into the input raw .json files saved in path ``../data/raw``.

## Overview of Class, SuperClass, and Main function <a name="class"></a>

The three preprocessor output classes (Class DeliverooPreprocessor, Class FbmkplacePreprocessor, Class KukdPreprocessor) inherit from the super-Class Preprocessor (saved in _Preprocessor.py_). For simplicity, and unless stated otherwise, the three aforementioned classes will be called 'output class' in this documentation. The super-Class Preprocessor returns the raw .json file-paths from the scraping stage, and the output classes preprocess the .json files into a cleaned dataframe.

The whole preprocessing process is automated by initiating the `main` function in _preprocess.py_. All output dataframes have the same columns:

> `PlatformBusinessName`, `PlatformBusinessAddress`, `PlatformPostCode`, `PlatformName`, `PlatformFHRSID`, `PlatformRatingValue`, `PlatformRating`,
 `PlatformTags`, `PlatformDescription`, `ScrapingSearch`, `ScrapingTime`

## Deliveroo and Kukd Preprocessors <a name="deliverookukd"></a>

_DeliverooPreprocessor.py_ and _KukdPreprocessor.py_ are designed to preprocess data from the Delivero and Kukd website, respectively, into dataframes. The class object takes the raw .json file and cleans the data. See below for a sample cleaned data from these preprocessors:

## Facebook Marketplace Preprocessor <a name="fb"></a>

The _FbmktplacePreprocessor.py_ is slightly different from the previous two preprocessors. The main difference is that data from the Facebook Marketplace contain no addresses, no postcodes, and no definite business names; instead, the data mainly contains descriptive texts. However, to achieve a relatively uniform output, the data from the Facebook Marketplace are still preprocessed into the same dataframe structure as the previous two preprocessors, in the format shown in the table below.

## Potential Improvements <a name="improvements"></a>

* There is a fair amount of encoding and decoding of **unicodes (symbols and emojis)** in the data from Facebook Marketplace. This is done by registering the escape ``\`` key in the .json file. There is also quite a lot of regex processing for different **URLs**. <br> As the text conversion of marketplace posts to dataframe requires extensive cleaning, in situations where there are unexpected escape signs, the preprocessor may not decode the text properly (this happened once when scraping the net with the search term "london, takeaway food").

* As mentioned previously, we have opted for a **uniform output** from our preprocessors despite the significant differences in the input information as this facilitates further processes down the pipeline. This means that some effort needs to be put into adapting the scrape data into the specific format - and, due to the particularities of each website, there is no universal method that applies. This approach might have to be reconsidered in future developments.
