## Description <a name="description"></a>

In the context of this FHRSOP project, we reviewed the ethical implications of scraping and analysing data from online Food Business Operators (FBOs). This review was based on the [Data Ethics Canvas](https://theodi.org/article/data-ethics-canvas/), which is a framework created by the Open Data Institute that helps to identify and manage ethical issues at the start of a project and throughout.

## Data Ethics Canvas for FHRSOP <a name="canvas"></a>

|Title   |Description   |Comments   |Actions   |
|---|---|---|---|
|__1. Data sources:__|Name/describe your project’s data sources, whether you are collecting data yourself or accessing via third parties. Is any personal data involved, or data that is otherwise sensitive?|We are web-scraping third-party websites. Some sites may include personal information (e.g., address, names)  | We limit the fields to be scraped to ones not likely to contain personal data. We will manually check a subset of data to ensure personal data is not scraped. We will also flag issues when handling the project   |
|__2. Limitations in data sources:__|Are there limitations that could influence your project’s outcomes? Consider bias in data collection, inclusion/exclusion, analysis, algorithms gaps or omissions in data provenance and data quality and other issues affecting decisions, such as team composition | Possible biases include geographical, cultural (certain sections of society may be more prone to use a platform), and food type. Gaps depending on data provenance and quality can arise from accessibility issues - some sites may be easier to access than others |  |
|__3. Sharing data with others:__| Are you going to be sharing data with other organisations? If so, who? Are you planning to publish any of the data? Under what conditions? | No data sharing will happen outside FSA and there are no plans for publication |  |
|__4. Ethical and legislative context:__| What existing ethical codes apply to your sector or project? What legislation, policies, or other regulation shape how you use data? What requirements do they introduce? Consider the rule of law; human rights; data protection; IP and database rights; anti-discrimination laws; and data sharing, policies, regulation and ethics | The legal framework of web scraping is complex. There are also issues surrounding potential breaching of the Terms and Conditions of some sites that explicitly prohibit automated access of information |Legal advice by the FSA legal team will be sought after the project is handed over |
|__5. Rights around data sources:__| Where did you get the data from? Is it produced by an organisation or collected directly from individuals? Was the data collected for this project or for another purpose? Do you have permission to use this data, or another basis on which you are allowed? What ongoing rights will the data source have? | Data analysed in this project is generated by FBOs. Data is specifically collected for this project and the FSA has permission to access food business name and address data |  |
|__6. Your reason for using data:__| What is your primary purpose for collecting and using data in this project? What are your main use cases? What is your business model? Are you making things better for society? How and for whom? Are you replacing another product or service as a result of this project? | The primary purpose is to study the online landscape of FBOs in the UK. We present some case studies of online FBO compliance with FSA hygiene regulations. Our project will make things better for society by helping increase overall food safety. FHRSOP does not replace any existing product or service, it supplements existing frameworks |  |
|__7. Communicating your purpose:__| Do people understand your purpose – especially people who the data is about or who are impacted by its use? How have you been communicating your purpose? Has this communication been clear? How are you ensuring more vulnerable individuals or groups understand? | People broadly understand food inspections and safety carried out by FSA. From the start of the project, we engaged with the FSA Communications Team to ensure that the project will adequately target food safety. We will reevaluate the implications once data is collected
 |  |
|__8. Positive effects on people:__| Which individuals, groups, demographics or organisations will be positively affected by this project? How? How are you measuring and communicating positive impact? How could you increase it? | Both consumers (via increased food safety) and sellers (via increased awareness of regulations) will be positively affected by the project. The communication of impact is not in the scope of the project |  |
|__9. Negative effects on people:__| Who could be negatively affected by this project? Could the way that data is collected, used or shared cause harm or risk individuals being re-identified? Could it be used to target, profile or prejudice people, or unfairly restrict access (e.g., exclusive arrangements)? How are limitations and risks communicated to people? Consider people who the data is about, people impacted by its use and organisations using the data. | Unregistered and non-compliant businesses and individuals who sell food (particularly if not registered with FSA) could be negatively affected by the project. Websites that aggregate FBOs and do not comply with regulations or inform customers could also be affected. The results of the project could potentially result in profiling/prejudicing of platforms. At present, there is no communication of risk to people impacted by its use |  |
|__10. Minimising negative impact:__| What steps can you take to minimise harm? How could you reduce any limitations in your data sources? How are you keeping personal and other sensitive information secure? How are you measuring, reporting and acting on potential negative impacts of your project? What benefits will these actions bring to your project? | We will reevaluate the results and the pipeline to detect potential biases. Security will be ensured by keeping the project private and local. The assessment of the potential negative impacts of the project will be reviewed at a later stage - this is a pilot study so that kind of assessment is outside the present scope. Benefits will include ensuring that we are doing the right thing |  |
|__11. Engaging with people:__| How can people engage with you about the project? How can people correct information, appeal or request changes to the product/service? To what extent? Are appeal mechanisms reasonable and well understood? | There is no public engagement at the moment. The other questions are not applicable for this project |
|__12. Openness and transparency:__| How open can you be about this project? Could you publish your methodology, metadata, datasets, code, or impact measurements? Can you ask peers for feedback on the project? How will you communicate it internally? Will you publish your actions and answers to this canvas openly? | The project is property of the FSA. We will ask for feedback and communicate internally in an informal way. The answers to this Ethics Canvas will be sent to the FSA |
|__13. Ongoing implementation:__| Are you routinely building in thoughts, ideas, and considerations of people affected in your project? How? What information or training might be needed to help people understand data issues? Are systems, processes, and resources available for responding to data issues that arise in the long-term? | Ethics considerations are incorporated by developing this Ethics Canvas framework. We will have a formal presentation at the end of the project for the FSA. This project is a pilot study, so there are no mechanisms implemented for a longer-term assessment |
|__14. Reviews and iterations:__| How will ongoing data ethics issues be measured, monitored, discussed, and actioned? How often will your responses to this canvas be reviewed or updated? When? | This Ethics Canvas will be updated as needed throughout the project |
|__15. Your actions:__| What actions will you take before moving forward with this project? Which should take priority? Who will be responsible for these actions, and who must be involved? Will you openly publish your actions and answers to this canvas? | The first step moving forward would be the approval of proof of concept by FSA. FSA will be responsible for these actions. The responses to this Ethics Canvas will be sent to the FSA when handing over the project |

## Further Discussion Points <a name="discussion"></a>

Throughout the project, we have had extensive discussions on ethical issues that may not have been reflected in the Ethics Canvas: 

* Regarding **privacy**, we discussed which sections of the posts on Facebook Marketplace should be considered personal data or not. These discussions took place both on the personal level within the team, and with the FSA and Pivigo on GDPR regulations. There were several lines of thoughts and measures in place to guide us through the scraping process: i) we were clearly informed by the FSA that the project objective was to map out the landscape of common food items, and not the traceability of individual sellers; ii) we ensured that the web crawling activity was done in Incognito mode, which means that Facebook will not show sellers’ contact details; iii) when doing the keyword search, we made sure the search terms returned mostly food results by visual examination and therefore minimising accessing non-food posts that are not under FSA’s remit; and iv) in the data processing stage, we programmatically removed any URLs (link to emails or websites) and numbers (phone numbers) so that no personal information of any kind was stored in the database that we generated for the project.

* Concerning **fairness**, currently, FHRSOP can generate biased results in several fronts. First, the data we collect for our case studies are based on particular locations (i.e., restaurants that deliver to E16AW in London and items posted on Facebook Marketplace in London with specific keywords). Determining exactly how these potential biases may affect the results of FHRSOP is beyond the scope of this pilot study as we do not have enough data (both in terms of quantity and the diversity of platforms/locations). We believe that future analyses should be carried out to assess how fair the pipeline is.
